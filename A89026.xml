            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

I lighted ſome times upon a wittie interpretation of this paſſage in a certain <hi>Manuſcript;</hi> and the interpretation was this. That the opening of the world by Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and Commerce, and the increaſe of knowledge, ſhould meet both in one time, or age. The obſervation is juſtified by experience, howſoever Divines may judge as they ſee cauſe of the congruitie thereof unto <hi>Daniels</hi> text. And this increaſe of knowledge, which theſe latter times have brought forth, appeares in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more remarkeably, then in the interpretation of this myſterious booke, the Revelation of Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> And as the mother of <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of the vertuous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whom ſhe deſcribeth, <hi>Pro</hi> 31.29. <hi>Many daughters have done vertuouſly, but thou ſurmounteſt them all.</hi> In like ſort may it be ſaid of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Mede</hi> in reference to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Many Interpreters have done excellently, but he ſurmounteth them all. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there ſhould this ſeeme ſtrange, that being advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb facs="tcp:111329:3"/>
by the labours of thoſe that went before him, hee hath added ſomething of his owne, wherein hee hath ſurpaſſed others, yet without diſparagement to any; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, any man may adde ſomething to the labours of others, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath it, <hi>Ethic.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; by theſe meanes Arts grow to perfection. Thus wee ſalve the credit of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Writers, though in ſome things, many of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age doe excell them; for they have carried us on their ſhoulders to a great height by their inſtructions, and for us to ſoare a little higher, it is no great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of our abilities; certainly no diſparagement at all to them by whom we have profited in an high degree. Thus a dwarfe lifted up on a tall mans ſhoulders may eaſily diſcover much more then hee; thankes be to the tall man for it. Thus a Wren carried on an Eagles ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to the higheſt pitch of her ſoaring aloft, if, when the Eagle is weary, the Wren ſprings up ſomewhat higher; this is no great glory to the Wren, much leſſe any diſhonour to the Eagle.</p>
            <p>Yet to confeſſe a truth, <hi>Maſter Mede</hi> hath many notions of ſo rare a nature, that I do not finde he is beholding to any other for them, but onely to his owne ſtudiouſneſſe and dexteritie, with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God upon his labours.</p>
            <p>And here, Firſt, I doe obſerve Gods direction of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> him in the courſe that he hath taken.</p>
            <p>(1.) As Firſt, in his <hi>Clavis Apocalyptica,</hi> the <hi>Key</hi> of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> wherein hee hath drawne together the homogeneall parts of it, diſperſed here and there, yet belonging to the ſame time; the indiſtinction where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may expoſe many to no ſmall errour ere hee be aware, conceaving all the Paſſages in the <hi>Revelation</hi> to be ordered in place, according to the order of
<pb facs="tcp:111329:3"/>
time wherein they were fulfilled, which is found to be other wiſe, as in the <hi>Key</hi> is manifeſted, repreſenting many perticulers mentioned in different places, yet belonging to the ſame time.</p>
            <p>(2.) Secondly, the Authour gave himſelfe to write <hi>Specimina Eſſayes;</hi> wherein he goes over every part of this book (excepting the three firſt Chapters) taking a generall view of each as he goes.</p>
            <p>(3.) Thirdly, he proceeds to a more full Comentari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from the fourth Chapter to the fourteenth, that which followeth from thence to the end, containes onely his former conceptions, which he called <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina Eſſayes,</hi> or firſt adventures.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas in performancies of this nature, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> two things are neceſſarily required. 1. A right diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the meaning of the words and phraſe, which for the moſt part is Figurative and Tropicall, the more exactly to finde out the ſenſe of the Prophecie thereby. 2. A right accomodation of each part, unto the proper time of the Hiſtorie, concerning the accompliſhment of things foretold.</p>
            <p>(1.) As for the firſt of theſe, the whole Body of the <hi>Revelation</hi> for the moſt part, being carried along by Figurative expreſſions: it is requiſite to obſerve the <hi>Genius</hi> of Scripture phraſe in this kinde; wherein <hi>Maſter Mede</hi> excells, and hereby the ſenſe is cleared in ſuch ſort as to give great ſatisfaction. As in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the myſterie of the battell in heaven, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. and the caſting downe of Satan unto the earth, hee ſhewes that States and Kingdomes in the world Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall, are indeed much anſwerable to the condition of the world Naturall, and accordingly repreſented in Scripture: for as the world Naturall conſiſts of heaven and earth: ſo in each State a Kingdome is
<pb facs="tcp:111329:4"/>
found ſomwhat anſwerable hereunto, and that is the Nobilitie and the Laitie. And as in heaven there are Sunne, Moone, and Starres of leſſer and greater mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude: ſo in every Kingdome there is a King and Queene, and Nobles, and that in great varietie of degrees of magnitude. And as in the earth there is great variety of creatures, as of trees of various ſorts, and of herbs and flowers: ſo in the people of any Common-wealth, is found great varietie of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. And upon this ground, and by this courſe of interpretation which hee taketh, whereas other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters many times give prety interpretations, which the Reader perhaps could wiſh to be true; <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Mede</hi> by his grounds and manner of proceeding convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Reader of the truth of that ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Text, which is delivered by him, even to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>
            <p>(2) And when this is done, as for the accomodation of the matter of fact in this prophecie thus interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, unto its proper time; this requireth great skill in Hiſtory; and I have found that <hi>Maſter Medes</hi> friends, who have been acquainted with the courſe of his Studies, would give him the bell for this, as herein out-ſtripping all others.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I have obſerved ſome notable diſtinctions in this Comentarie of Maſter <hi>Mede,</hi> which have given me <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> great content, as giving great light to the cleare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of many things which otherwiſe would prove very obſcure. As for example.</p>
            <p>(1) The diſtinction between the book-ſealed with ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſeales, which he calles the greater book; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents whereof indeed are very large, containing an Hiſtory from the beginning of the preaching of the Goſpel, to the end of the world: and this hee ſaith,
<pb facs="tcp:111329:4"/>
containes <hi>fata imperij,</hi> the fortunes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> deſtinies of the Empire, (2) and the little book mentioned, <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. which he ſaith containes <hi>fata Eccleſiae,</hi> the fortunes or deſtinies of the Church. The firſt containes the ſeaven Seales, and the ſeaven Trumpets; for the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Seale produceth the ſeaven Trumpets.</p>
            <p>(1) The ſix firſt Seales containe the Storie of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires continuance unto the dayes of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; in whoſe dayes there being a ſtrange Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis of the Empire from Heathen to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, this change is repreſented in ſuch a manner, as if it were the ending of the world, and the beginning of a new; which in my conceit ſeems very judiciouſly delivered by him.</p>
            <p>(2) Then the ſeaven Trumpets (which are the contents and matter of the ſeaventh Seale) repreſent the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God upon the world, for ſtanding out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Goſpel; and ſhedding the blood of the Saints.</p>
            <p>(1) By the heathen Emperours, and for that cauſe, ruine was brought upon the Empire by degrees, untill it was rent and torne into ten Kingdomes, which is ſet forth by the parts thereof in foure degrees, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ills up the materiall contents of the foure firſt Trumpets.</p>
            <p>(2) The other three Trumpets are called <hi>Woe</hi> Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, containing the judgements of God upon the Antichriſtian world, the degenerate States of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, (Firſt) by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> the contents of the firſt <hi>Woe</hi> Trumpet. (2) By the Turkes, the contents of the ſecond <hi>Woe</hi> Trumpet, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. (3) By the end of the world, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 15.</p>
            <p>(2) Another diſtinction there is mentioned by him, and which carrieth great light with it, of great uſe for
<pb facs="tcp:111329:5"/>
the clearing of the ſtate of Chriſts glorious Kingdom here on earth: and that is, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.24. <hi>And the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are ſaved</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, which eſcape the fire, or are ſaved from the fire at Chriſts coming) <hi>ſhall walk in the light of new Ieruſalem:</hi> by which it appeares clearly that <hi>new Ieruſalem</hi> is one thing, and <hi>the Nations that eſcape and are ſaved from the fire,</hi> wherewith the earth and all the workes thereof ſhall be burnt in the day of Chriſts coming, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. and 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. and 2. theſe I ſay are another thing, and muſt be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from new <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> For in the light of this new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> thoſe nations ſhall walk, as is expreſly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And the diſtinction <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Mede</hi> conceaves to be this; By new <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is meant Chriſt and his raiſed Saints, who are called the Saints whom he ſhall bring with him, 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. and by the nations are meant, all the faithfull ſervants of God who ſhall be found here alive at Chriſts coming.</p>
            <p>(3) And I finde that the want of diſtinguiſhing theſe, the ancient Fathers, and perticularly <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> have diſcourſed very wildely againſt the glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt here on earth, yet in juſt oppoſition to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> whoſe guiſe it was to diſcourſe very carnally of the glorious Kingdome of Chriſt; The conſideration whereof moved <hi>Auſtin</hi> to relinquiſh the doctrine of Chriſts Kingdome here on earth, which formerly hee embraced, as himſelf profeſſeth in one of his works <hi>Decivitate Dei,</hi> where he treats thereof.</p>
            <p>(4) Yet as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Mede</hi> hath (in my judgement) excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in merit all others that went before him in this Argument; ſo others after him, may go beyond him in ſome perticulars; As to inſtance in a perticular, or two or three.</p>

            <p>(2) The ſame Maſter <hi>Potter</hi> hath other ſtrange myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to be diſcovered out of the ſame number, and eſpecially out of the fraction thereof, which as yet he hath not made publike.</p>
            <p>(3) So likewiſe in explication of the myſterie of the two Beaſts mentioned, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. hee differeth from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Mede.</hi> And I have ſeen an excellent diſcourſe thereupon, but as yet he hath not communicated it to the world. What cauſe have wee to bleſſe God for bringing us forth in theſe dayes of light: may we not apply that of <hi>Eſay</hi> unto theſe times? <hi>when darkeneſſe</hi>

            <p>(1) Not onely in reſpect of the great Reformation wrought in this Weſterne part of the world an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres agoe and more: God awaking as it were out of a ſleep, and like a gyant refreſhed with wine: and the Lord Chriſt awaking, and ſtirring up his ſtrength for the raiſing up of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and reſtoring the deſolations of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and bleſſing us with a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his Goſpel, and diſcovering the man of ſin, and blaſting him with the breath of his mouth.</p>
            <p>(2) But alſo opening the myſterie of the ſlaughter of the Witneſſes, which we have juſt reaſon to conceive to have beene on foot divers yeares, not by judiciall proceedings only in the Martyrdom of Gods Saints; but by the ſword of war, Firſt in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:111329:6"/>

            <p>After this ſtrange warre and ſlaughter of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which haſteneth to a Period, the continuance of it ſhall be but three years and an half, in which ſpace of time, they that dwell on the earth ſhall rejoyce over them and make merrie, and ſend gifts one to another, becauſe theſe prophets tormented them that dwelt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth. But after three dayes and an halfe when the Spirit of life from God ſhould enter into them, and they ſtand upon their feet, great feare ſhould fall upon them which ſaw them. And a voyce ſhall bee heard from heaven, ſaying unto them, Come up hither. And they ſhall aſcend up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies ſhall behold them: But certainely when that comes to paſſe, the ſame houre there ſhall be an Earthquake, and the tenth part of the Citie ſhall fall. This Citie undoubtedly is <hi>Rome,</hi> which Maſter <hi>Mede</hi> proveth curiouſly to be at this day preciſely the tenth part of the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it was in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> dayes when this prophecie came forth: and in the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes ſhall be ſlaine of men (of names of men) ſeaven thouſand; which Maſter <hi>Mede</hi> interpreteth men of qualitie.</p>
            <p>It followeth, <hi>The ſecond Woe is paſt;</hi> Now that Woe was the plague of the Chriſtian world by the Turkes: whereby is ſignified the deſtruction of the Turkes,

which people I take to be all one with <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> repreſented there as the great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Iewes invading the land of Jewrie. And the Hebrew doctors conceave that warre of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> to be yet to come.</p>
            <p>Here it may be objected, that the Turke is Lord of the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> already: I grant it, but when the time ſhall come for the calling of the Iewes, which Maſter <hi>Mede</hi> conceaved ſhould be wrought in a ſtrange manner, by the appearing of Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as he appeared unto <hi>Paul</hi> at his converſion: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledging that grace to have been ſhewed to him <hi>firſt,</hi> implying, that the like grace ſhould be ſhewed to others <hi>after him.</hi> Then I ſay, upon this their converſion, they ſhall gather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together from all places toward the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where ſhall be the place of Chriſts throne in his glorious kingdome here on earth: upon which coming of the Iewes into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> will be moved to raiſe all his power gathered together out of all Nations under him to oppoſe them, and at firſt ſhall prevaile, as we read, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 28. and <hi>Zachariah</hi> 14. in the beginning: but in the iſſue the Iewes ſhall prevaile. <hi>For Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours ſhall come up on Mount</hi> SION, <hi>and the Kingdome ſhall bee the Lords,</hi> Obadiah 21. <hi>Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall the Lord cauſe his Mightie ones to come downe.

               <hi>there bee one Lord, and his Name One,</hi> Zachariah 14. 9. So that this implies the calling of the Iewes a little before.

Moreover, that the preparation going before the ſound; is ſo deſcribed, that it muſt be confeſſed, that the thing was performed in the naked deſcriptions of the things ſeene in the volume (which way ſoever deſcribed) nay, nor yet in the ſimple writing, but altogether in forraigne repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation.</p>

                        <p>But that which the title further ſeemeth to intimate, that the ten horned Beaſt is wont alſo to be called by the name of the image of the Beaſt, that is not ſo evident, and which the reader except very attentive, will ſcarce at all perceive. But that the ſame is ſo, I think that I have obſerved upon good ground; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereſoever the Beaſt and the falſe prophet are mentioned together (which I finde three times) there by the ſurname of the Beaſt, is underſtood no other then the ten horned beaſt; when by the falſe prophet, it is evident there is meant the two horned. Contrarily, where with the Beaſt thou ſeeſt coupled the image of the Beaſt [as <hi>chap.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 9.11. <hi>chap.</hi> 15. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 19 <hi>ver.</hi> 20. and <hi>chap.</hi> 20. <hi>ver.</hi> 4.] there by the Beaſt is to be underſtood the falſe prophet; and by his image the ten horned Beaſt, or the ſeven headed reſtored: for this Beaſt ſeeing hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the falſe prophet to be his reſtorer, and that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth himſelfe to be guided by the will of him, as of his ſupreme Lord <hi>[chap.</hi> 13. <hi>verſe</hi> 12, 14, 15.] he is not without cauſe called his image; not whoſe ſimilitude hee repreſenteth, the genitive being paſſively taken (for in that reſpect he is the Image of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, happily of the ſeven headed dragon, or of the ſtate in in which hee flouriſhed before the wound, according to whoſe example he doth afreſh blaſpheme God, and make warre againſt the Saints) but that image which that two horned Beaſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like the Dragon did reſtore and challengeth for his owne, the genitive, to wit, ſignifying the Agent or Poſſeſlor; even as in the ſelf-ſame places that is not the marke of the Beaſt, which is ſtamped upon the Beaſt himſelfe, but wherewith that ſame Beaſt doth brand thoſe that worſhip him.</p>
                        <p>And that it is ſo, as I have ſaid, concerning the image of the Beaſt, that which is ſaid in the 13. <hi>chap. Verſe</hi> 15. is for an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the firſt place, that that very image of the Beaſt, which the falſe prophet did give life unto, did cauſe that whoſoever ſhall not worſhip the image of the Beaſt ſhould be ſlaine; likewiſe elſe where (that thou mayeſt know him to be the Beaſt) hee is almoſt ever put after a verb which ſignifies to adore, as an object of worſhip: when as therefore the Apocalyps doth pourtray onely two and no more Beaſts; this ſo wicked a majeſtie with

like power either of commanding or compelling, cannot but agree to either of them. Furthermore, where the Beaſt is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent together with the falſe prophet, the image of the Beaſt in the ſame conſtruction of words is not to be found, as if there the appellation of the Beaſt ſhould ſerve the turne.</p>

And thus far the matter is plaine and cleare: but the anteceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the inner court to the outward court (which is the onely thing that remaineth to perfect this <hi>Synchroniſme)</hi> is a little har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der taske to prove, becauſe the matter is otherwiſe taken, and therefore hindred with prejudice; yet thus I ſhew it. The inner court, according to the building of the temple, in ſituation and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is before the outer court being neereſt to the thro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </note> Therefore if the things ſignified be of divers times (for it is no new thing, that the order of ſituation ſhould expreſſe the order of time, as it is to be ſeen in the <hi>Statua</hi> in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> dream:) ſurely it is agreeable to reaſon, that the thing ſignified by the inner court ſhould bee in time before the thing ſignified by the outer. But that the things meant by the courts are of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times, and ſo that which is meant by the inner court more ancient and before the other. I thus farre demonſtrate, becauſe this viſion of the meaſuring of the court of the temple and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, or the inner court, is the beginning to the propheſie repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; which (as anon more at large ſhall be ſhewed) doth from the originall and very firſt beginning rehearſe the times of the propheſie of the ſeales, the beginning whereof no man doubteth to be fetcht from the very <hi>Epoche</hi> of the time of the Revelation.

If therefore the viſion of the woman bringing forth the childe and the war of the Dragon (which is part of this repeated propheſie) do aſcend to the very head of the period, or time of the Revelation, ſo that the Revelation hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ancient then it, or which deriveth its originall higher (which will be manifeſt as well out of the nature of the thing it ſelfe which is a birth, as alſo out of the <hi>Synchroniſmes</hi> hitherto demonſtrated, and hereafter to be demonſtrated:) why ſhould not much rather the beginning of the ſame propheſie, and the firſt viſion of all the reſt be thought to aſcend thither?

                     <p n="2">2. Then furthermore, as is the manner in hiſtories, that many and divers things, done by many and divers together, and at the ſame time, yet cannot be declared together, but ſeverally and one after another: ſo alſo in theſe prophecies and viſions of things done (howſoever revealed in the moſt apteſt and wiſeſt order by far) it falleth out, that they labour in vain that ſo go about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the Revelation, as if the events every where ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed one after another in the ſame order and courſe, as the viſions are revealed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For truely he that will endevour with ſucceſſe to finde out the meaning of the Apocalyptique viſions, muſt firſt of all place the courſe, and conne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore (which we ſee to be done amiſſe by very many) the order it ſelf is not to be conformed to every aptnes of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to the will of the interpreter; but according to to the Idoea of this chronicall order framed before hand; by the characters of Synchroniſmes is every interpretation to be tryed as it were by a ſquare and plumb-rule.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For without ſuch foundation, thou ſhalt ſcarce draw any thing out of the Revelation, that will ſoundly aſſure the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and application thereof, and which reſteth upon divine authoritie, but upon begged principles, and meere humane

gather out of the poſition of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and the Cherubims in this viſion one againſt another, which climate of the world each face of the Cherubims looked towards. For when <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> his face being turned toward the north, beheld the Cherubims as it were <note place="margin">Ezek. 1.4.</note> coming againſt him, certainly that which did then preſent it ſelf directly over againſt him, was the former and direct face of the Cherubims, to wit the face of man; and therefore the face of a man looked toward the ſouth.

                  <hi>Ezekiel</hi> looked towards the Eaſt, and that on the left hand of him, of a bullock looking toward the Weſt: and laſt of all the face of an Eagle looking toward the North.</p>
               <p>And ſurely the ſame reaſon perſwadeth, that we may eſteeme that thoſe Cherubims alſo, which did overſhadow the Arke of God in the moſt holy place of the Temple were alike, that is, of a foure faſhioned face; eſpecially ſince thoſe which were engraven upon the walles of the temple were ſo, as that which is read in the ſame <hi>Ezekiel, chap.</hi> 41. <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. concerning their half carving doth witneſſe, where, two of their faces being drunk up, (as it muſt needs be in ſuch engraving) on the plaine of a wall, yet the other two, of a man and of a lion, are ſaid to appeare looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Palme-trees, repreſented on this ſide and on that ſide, both wayes.

                        <p>It is granted among all Divines that the workes of Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and government, are executed by the adminiſtration of Angels. The Angels therefore in thoſe Viſions hold their place, over whom they are appointed by God to bring things to paſſe; and what is executed by the common meanes, as well of Angels, as of men, that is ſaid to be brought to paſſe, the Angels being Authours, as it were guides, and Captaines. So that they ſeeme to me to erre altogether from the ſcope, who thinke ſome other myſterie lyeth hidden under theſe names of Angels. The Angels therefore the Trumpeters, of whom the ſpeech is here, are they which are appointed to direct the plagues of the Trumpets, uſing thoſe men for execution, by whom it pleaſeth God to bring to paſſe his decrees.</p>

And at length after this manner <hi>theſe tenne Kingdomes,</hi> into <note place="margin">Chap. 8.</note> which the holy Ghoſt had foretold, as well by <hi>Daniel,</hi> as by <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Romane Empire at the laſt ſhould be divided, ſeeme to be reckoned; and not at all to be eſteemed according to ſo many <hi>bare names</hi> (as uſually is done) of ſo many regions, or tracts of land, but rather Kingdomes, into which the Dominion and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Empire ſhould be rent. Yet notwithſtanding let us not thinke that the limitation of this number of tenne is to be ſo ſtrictly conſtrued, that it excludeth at any time more Kingdomes, or any manner of governments: but that the Empire ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into ten at the leaſt, or into ten principall Kingdoms. That which even from that originall rending which we have ſet forth untill our age, under ſo many fates and alterations, I think to have been alwaies the truth; although it were ſufficient for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this truth, if onely in the beginning it had been divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo many Kingdomes, howſoever happily afterwards the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were diminiſhed. But the like propheſie concerning the rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Monarchie of <hi>Alexander,</hi> may teach us that ſo as I have ſaid, and not otherwiſe, that limitation of the number of ten Kingdomes is to be underſtood: in which, although beſides theſe foure principall Kingdomes, of <hi>Macedonia, Aſia, Syria,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> a fift alſo <hi>Thracia</hi> was added, <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> being the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: yet the holy Ghoſt bounded that multiplicitie in a number of foure. Reckon them to be ſo many at the leaſt, or ſo many prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Kingdomes. For there was no ſucceſſion in the Kingdome of <hi>Thracia,</hi> though it began together with the reſt, and endured forty yeeres, but it ended with the firſt King <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> and therefore not to be brought into the number. The like hereunto is to be judged of this ten fold Romane diviſion. Wherefore, let it move no man, if beſides the Kingdomes reckoned up in <hi>France</hi> he ſhall happily finde there the Kingdome alſo of the <hi>Alanes</hi> of <hi>Orleance,</hi> and alſo the dynaſtie of the Cities of <hi>Baitaine,</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Empire of <hi>Honorius</hi> untill theſe times. For he ſhall finde the latter to be but of a very meane Dominion, the other to have from thence endured but a ſmall time, to wit, tenne yeeres at the moſt. Neither of them therefore to be reckoned with the reſt for like place and order, nor if any be to be found of the ſame ſort otherwhere.</p>

Now let us come to the text: <hi>And I will give,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>unto</hi>

                     <hi>and threeſcore dayes, cloathed with ſackcloth.</hi> Where this cometh firſt to be obſerved that the whole propheſie which followeth, from this verſe to the ſounding of the ſeventh trumpet, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the matter ſo requiring, is exhibited not in a viſion, but was dictated to <hi>Iohn</hi> by an Angel, perſonating Chriſt, the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof is of no ſmall conſequence for the better percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the nature of the allegory or type.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To my two witneſſes]</hi> he calleth them two in regard of the type, which, as I ſaid, is of paires; as if he ſhould have ſaid, I will give to my <hi>Zorobabel</hi> and <hi>Ieſua,</hi> to my <hi>Eliah</hi> and <hi>Eliſaeus,</hi> to my <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> To which is added that he calleth them wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, now by the Law there ought to be two witneſſes to confirme every word. Add that they may be called two, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the number of the Tables of God, which they uſed in their propheſie, of the Old and New Teſtament, as it were witneſſes of two Teſtaments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That they ſhall propheſie cloathed with ſackcloth]</hi> to wit, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be wayling the trampling under foot of the holy Citie by the bringing in of the Idolatry of the Gentiles, giving teſtimony to the truth of God, and exhorting to repentance.</p>
                  <p>1260 <hi>dayes]</hi> as many, to wit, as are contained in 42 moneths. Which that they are not naturall dayes, it appeareth as well out of thoſe three dayes and an halfe, parts of theſe dayes, a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be aſſigned to the death of the witneſſes; which that they cannot be taken for naturall dayes, thoſe things which are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told to be then done doe prove: as alſo out of that that the Beaſt (the meaſure of whoſe time they alſo doe containe) contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized with the company of the 144000 ſealed: and the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſealed with the ſixe firſt trumpets: but the matters of the trumpets could not be run out, in ſo little time as in 1260 na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall dayes, or in the ſpace of three yeere and an half. But thou wilt aske, why is the prophanation of the Gentiles meaſured by moneths, and the propheſie of the witneſſes defending the pure worſhip of God by dayes? Forſooth, becauſe the worſhipping of idols, and every ſinne and errour is of the power of darkneſſe and night, wherein the Moon ruleth; contrariwiſe true Religion is compared to the light and to the day of which the Sunne is the

The deſcription whereof is wholly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact out of the hiſtorie of the paſſion of our Lord. For the Lord Ieſus likewiſe when he had ended his preaching of about ſo many dayes as the propheſie of the Witneſſes amount to, is ſlaine by the Romane Governour the Legate of this beaſt between whom and the Witneſſes there is warre (but in the time of his ſixt head) the third day after there being likewiſe a great earthquake he roſe againe. And a little after, to wit, upon the fortieth day, being received in a cloud he aſcended into heaven. All which things God would have to be repreſented in this ſlaughter of his witneſſes by his owne death; that like as they have borne the likeneſſe of thoſe renowned paires (of which is ſpoken before)

                  <p>The other concerning warre and ſlaughter I conjecture is yet to come. But our <hi>Brightman</hi> thought it already fulfilled, to wit, in the <hi>Smalcaldian</hi> warre under the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth. Others apply it to the late ruine of the Churches of Germany. And who would not much rather that ſo lamentable an accident to the Church were paſt, then to feare it to be yet to come? But the interpretation is not to be directed according to our wiſh. Yea rather the errour will be with greater danger on that part then on the contrary. For the expectation of a future calamity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth more to piety, then an over-credulous ſecuritie thereof, as if it were already paſt. There are two things which perſwade me that this laſt deſtruction is yet to be feared. The firſt that thoſe lamentable times of the Gentiles trampling under foot the holy Citie, or Chriſtian Religion, or the times of the forty two moneths, cannot be ſaid to have fulfilled their period ſo long as the Beaſt ſhall reigne: and therefore neither the <hi>Dayes of the Witneſſes</hi> mourning in ſackcloth, being of the ſame time and of the ſame age with them. Another becauſe this deſtruction of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:111329:83"/>
                     <hi>Witneſſes</hi> is to be the next antecedent (as we ſhall heare after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) <note place="margin">Chap. 11.</note> to the deſtruction and ruine of the great Citie, that is, <hi>Rome:</hi> which the <note n="*" place="margin">Series.</note> courſe of the Phyals ſuffereth not to be ſo neet come; conſidering that we have not paſſed the fourth of them as yet (although we hope it is in agitation in the preſent Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane warres) as there it ſhall be taught. But that the ruine of the Citie belongeth to the fifth we ſhall ſhew anon. Whoſe forerunner therefore that this deſtruction ſhall be which we have in hand, it is very probable; eſpecially, ſince it is uſuall with Chriſt our Captaine, to ſubdue his enemies and to reward his with victory, by the method of the Croſſe. Neither yet becauſe this deſtruction is the laſt, and even yet to come, can any thing be certainly determined, concerning the grievouſneſſe thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> have gone before; for happily not ſo much in reſpect of the grievouſneſſe (certainly not of the long continuance) as that it ſhould be for a ſigne of the mourning of the Witneſſes then forthwith to be ended, and of the ruine of the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> being at hand; therefore it alone of all the deſtructions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Beaſt ſhould afflict the Saints, deſerved a ſingular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and deſcription: even as indeed the environing of the inhabitants of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by the Armie of <hi>Ceſtius Gallus,</hi> a little before the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But the ſlaughter where with the Witneſſes are foretold to be overcome by the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> I thinke is to be underſtood in the moſt generall ſignification, wherein he comprehendeth death alſo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically or analogica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The killing therefore of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> if we expound it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſuch a rule of underſtanding, it will ſeeme to be a mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation and dejection of them from the office and place which they a little while had gotten in the reformed Church, by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>In the meane time leſt happily any one may be deceived, this is diligently to be obſerved: that this laſt warre of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> is not of the ſame kinde with that which he had waged continually hitherunto againſt the company of the Saints (of which indeed in the hiſtory of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.7. <hi>That it was given unto him to make w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Whether this be to be taken for a part of crueltie, or benefit, it is doubtfull; nor is it to be determined but by the fulfilling of the propheſie.

Nay, it were not indeed ſufficient for the providing of them. Adde hereunto that the halfe of a day properly ſo taken, or twelve houres, were altogether unfit for determining of ſuch acts.

And who knoweth whether or no the reformed Church ſhall be worthily puniſhed for the reproach offered Chriſt in this behalfe, by the taking away of the witneſſes for a time; becauſe they reverenced them not according to the dignitie of their embaſſage, while they enjoyed them. It is too well knowne what offence the reformed Churches commit in this behalfe: and that while the Prophets of Chriſt mightily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirred themſelves in reforming of the Church of God, others in the meane while diſgraced that moſt ſacred worke, by pillaging and interverting the maintenance thereof; not leaving in ſome places ſo much as food (to the great diſgrace of true Religion) whereby the Miniſters thereof might be honeſtly ſuſtained and according to the dignitie of their calling; much leſſe that any thing ſhould abound which they might ſet aſide for the enlarging of the reformation, the neceſſities of the holy warre, the reliefe of afflicted brethren, and other pious uſes.

Firſt, ſince there is no fall of the decaying Beaſt but is contained in ſome of the phyalls, therefore the ſam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> deſtruction of the Beaſt is here deſcribed which belongeth to the powring out of the fift phyall. For proofe, there is the ſame ſubject of the plague in both; there, <hi>the ſeate or throne of the Beaſt,</hi> here that <hi>Great Citie.</hi> For that that <hi>Great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> to wit <hi>Rome,</hi> is the ſeat of the Beaſt, is ſo evident, that there needeth no proofe. Further it is confirmed; becauſe the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which is here deſcribed, doth ſo neerely goe before the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aboliſhing of the Beaſt at the ſeventh trumpet, that nothing is ſhewed to have come betweene but the departure of the ſecond <hi>woe.</hi> And now the utter aboliſhing of the Beaſt is the worke of the laſt phyall; the departure of the ſecond <hi>woe</hi> or of that plague from Euphrates, is of the ſixt phyall. Therefore the deſtruction of the great Citie which next preventeth that departure, falleth into the fift phyall. The other thing by us to be premiſed, is, that the fall of the great Citie, is the very ſame deſtruction of Babylon which is ſung, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. It is proved, becauſe it is certaine out of the ſame Chapter, that that deſtruction of Babylon or of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">Verſ. 2.</note> of Rome, was to goe before the full deſtruction of the Beaſt, and the Emperiall Raigne of Chriſt to be begun with, the ſeventh trumpet. But now the deſtruction of the ſame Citie which is here declared, doth ſo neerely goe before that ſame kingdome, that the ſpirit, preſently paſſeth to that kingdome, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the ſeventh trumpet, without mentioning any other deſtruction beſides. It muſt needs therefore be that the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of that Citie is deſcribed in both. For who can be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:111329:88"/>
to thinke that the holy Ghoſt ſhould altogether let ſlip that <note place="margin">Chap. 11.</note> great deſtruction, interpoſing the mention of ſome leſſe deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with it no way to be compared.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being thus, it followeth, that the interpretation of this place is to be directed by the rule thereof, and as it were to be tryed by the ſame touchſtone; and ſo ſuch a meaning of theſe words to be ſought, as may agree with the deſcription of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Babylon.

                  <p>I ſeeke therefore another interpretation. And firſt it cometh into my minde, that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, is happily a name of <hi>tribute;</hi> either of that which the Pope receiveth out of the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Beaſt, or of that which the <hi>Citie</hi> it ſelfe receiveth out of her large poſſeſſions by right of Lordſhip. That <hi>tenth of the Citie</hi> ſhall fall in that great commotion of affaires, that is, ſhall <hi>ceaſe;</hi> and thereby is intimated, that the principalitie of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhall be utterly extinguiſhed; to wit, deprived of the ground allotted for her patrimonie (and the Pope thence driven by force) looſing the prerogative and dominion, which ſhe was wont to have over Cities and People farre and wide; when, that Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative and Dominion which ſhe had gotten, ſhall continue no longer; to wit, the Metropolis of the Kingdome of the Beaſt, or Seat of the falſe Prophet.

Symbole of Dominion, and by that name the moſt Provinces, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Chap. 11.</note> the Empire of ancient <hi>Rome</hi> payed yeerely the tenth part of all their fruits. Which that it was uſuall alſo in the Eaſtern king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, may be proved as well out of 1. <hi>Macca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the circuit of the Citie at this day by the walles wherewith <note place="margin">Chap. 11.</note> now it is compaſſed: for without, contrary to that of old, it is not at this day inhabited, but the whole, how great ſoever it is, is encloſed with wals, and wals w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Popes <hi>Hadrianus</hi> the firſt and <hi>Leo</hi> the fourth as it were by fatall inſtinct made the utmoſt bound thereof, being now become the Seat as it were of the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall kingdom, for ſo <hi>Blondus</hi> delivereth, that the wals which are now extant were built by <hi>Hadrian</hi> 1, by gathering 100000 crounes out of <hi>Thuſcia.</hi> Thoſe afterward, as it is known out of others, <hi>Leo</hi> 4 either repaired or finiſhed about the yeere of our Lord 850 and by adding that part which is beyond the river or builded by <hi>Leo,</hi> made up the Citie in that forme and circuit wherein it is now ſeene.

                  <p>That I may now at length make an end, the ſumme commeth to this; the holy Ghoſt would ſay or intimate this, that ſo much of the <hi>great Citie,</hi> as had remained to this earthquake, was at that time ruined, to wit, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>the tenth part of the Citie,</hi> neither was there any more to be ſtanding at that time. Nine parts many ages before were to fall, and truly we ſee they are fallen; partly by deſtructions and ruines, which the <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſo many times brought upon it, partly decaying with overmuch oldneſſe, partly alſo (as at the fourth trumpet we have ſhewed) thrown down with thunderbolts: the <hi>Tenth</hi> was reſerved by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine for the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was to be ordained head of the new Empire, and mother of the Chriſtian harlots.

That this ſcruple may by ſome means be ſatisfied; Firſt, it is to be obſerved, that by the name of the Citie here is underſtood, not citizens and inhabitants, but buildings and walles, that is, the royall Seat of the Beaſt: and ſo a double ruine of Babylon is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in theſe propheſies: Firſt, of Babylon taken for the royall Citie of the Beaſt, to wit, the <hi>Citie of Rome,</hi> at the fift phyall: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, of Babylon taken for the <hi>Citizens or State of Rome;</hi> which doubtleſſe the Pope with the Senate of Scarlet Cardinals &amp; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther company of Citizens, eſpecially Eccleſiaſticall do make.

For truely after ſo great a victory over the followers of the Beaſt, and their aſcending into the heaven of authoritie and honour, they ſhall put on ſackcloth no more. But now if the <hi>ſecond Woe,</hi> or the plague of the ſixt Trumpet, be that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of the Turkes from <hi>Euphrates</hi> into the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire now long ſince, as there we have interpreted: it can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be, but that this departure of the ſame plague, is that drying up of the water of <hi>Euphrates</hi> to come to paſſe at the powring out of the fifth <hi>phyall,</hi> whereby <hi>the way is prepared for the Kings of the Eaſt to come,</hi> Chap. 16. 12.</p>
                  <p>At which coming of the Kings of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> (leſt a gap be left otherwiſe betweene either Trumpet) the ſeventh Trumpet ſeemeth to beginne; and ſo that wonderfull preparation of the Dragon, Beaſt, and falſe Prophet, for the warre to be waged in <hi>Armageddon</hi> (there <hi>verſ.</hi> 13, 14. together with the event thereof at the laſt <hi>phyall (verſ.</hi> 17, &amp;c.) ought to be placed in the beginning of the ſame ſeventh Trumpet.

                  <p>But out of this a doubt ariſeth, which requireth ſatisfaction, and therefore not to be paſſed in ſilence. For ſince there is the ſame terme of forty two moneths of the Beaſt, as is of one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and ſixty dayes of the mourning of the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes;</hi> and ſince thoſe dayes of the mourning of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> are ended at the departure of the plague of the ſixt Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, or <hi>ſecond Woe;</hi> it may be demanded not unfitly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the moneths of the Beaſt ſhould not be further reckoned, ſince after that terme no little of the Beaſt yet remaineth, being not to be aboliſhed, before the ſeventh Trumpet is begun.</p>
                  <p>It may be anſwered, that this cometh to paſſe either becauſe then the converſion of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and as it were a new Kingdome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth (for they are called the <hi>Kings from the riſing of the Sun)</hi> or becauſe in the continuance of the Beaſt, conſideration is had eſpecially to the Empire of the Citie of Rome; but <hi>that great Citie</hi> the royall ſeat of the Beaſt in this earthquake is taken and overthrowne: even ſo farre, that from thenceforth the Beaſt ſhall as it were, change his forme, ſince being driven ſo from his

But thou wilt demand who is this <hi>Michael?</hi> Not, I ſuppoſe, Chriſt himſelf, but as in <hi>Daniel,</hi> unleſſe I be deceived, is manifeſt, one, yea even the chiefeſt, <hi>of the chiefe Princes, or ſeven Archangels, Chap.</hi> 10. 13. to wit, that great Angel, who in the ſame is ſaid, <hi>to ſtand for the children of God. Chap.</hi> 12. 1. and whom Chriſt that great chiefe Generall, and conſequently, King of Angels and men, hath ſo oppoſed againſt Sathan and his black guard raging againſt his Saints. For the Angels are ſent forth, <hi>for the ſafetie of them who are heires of ſalvation, Hebr.</hi> 1. 14. and they protect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, according to their hidden and inviſible manner of working, againſt evill ſpirits, which worke in men, that are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God and his Chriſt; although they appeare not in a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhape.

                  <p>Which words, as they are moſt cleere, and ſpoken without any obſcurity of allegory; ſo are they the key for interpreting the whole viſion.

                  <p>Here is the firſt attempt of Satan caſt downe, not indeed as yet utterly caſt out, but ſtaying a little while below; that while her child ſhould get the upper hand he might if by any meanes he could oppreſſe the <hi>Woman</hi> betaking her ſelfe to the eſtate of one in the <hi>wilderneſſe,</hi> before ſhe could in perfect ſafety from his fury attaine thither.

                  <p>But there is another thing in this <hi>verſe,</hi> which requireth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation: wherefore the time of the <hi>Womans</hi> abiding in the Wilderneſſe, which before was accounted by dayes, is here turned into yeers, or <hi>a time, times, and halfe a time?</hi> I certainly can finde out no other cauſe of this changing one for another, then that it ſhould be the Key of the like notation of time in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and ſhould admoniſh us, that the Church is now in the very ſame times, which he had defined, by the period of <hi>a time, times, and halfe a time.</hi> And ſurely without this ſigne that ſetting downe of time had beene moſt uncertaine, and intricate.

                     </p>
                     <p>As touching the <hi>Number,</hi> it is rather to be judged an Appendix of the <hi>Name or Marke of the Beaſt,</hi> then the marke it ſelf; and in very deed, it is the number, not ſo much of the name of the Beaſt as of the Beaſt himſelf; as alſo by and by it is called. Now it is therefore onely called the <hi>Number of the Name,</hi> becauſe it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in letters of the <hi>name of the Beaſt</hi> brought into number, God ſo diſpoſing it. Neither yet doth it follow, that becauſe the <hi>Number</hi> doth ſo neerely agree with the <hi>Name,</hi> therefore the <hi>number of the Beaſt</hi> is to be confounded with the <hi>Name:</hi> for the reaſon of the oppoſition requireth, that, even as in the company

Adde that the <hi>Marke of the Name</hi> and the <hi>Number</hi> are altogether of a different ſignification, I ſay, if we direct the interpretation according to the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>logie of other places. For the one, that is, <hi>the marke of the Name,</hi> doth ſhew to which Lord they have addicted themſelves who beare it. The other, that is, <hi>the Number</hi> ſheweth from what ſtock and from whence they derive their pedegree, who are marked therewith. As the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>twelve,</hi> and the number made out of the multiplication of <hi>twelve virgins,</hi> as in the ſtructure and dimenſions of <hi>now Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> is a ſymbole of the Apoſtolicall linage and off-ſpring.</p>
                     <p>But that we may ſtay no longer upon theſe generall things: let us ſee at length what may be that <hi>Name</hi> of the Beaſt, wherein alſo his <hi>Number</hi> noted by the holy Ghoſt is contained. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that which even then when the Revelation was newly written ſome ſuppoſed, that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

For by this name, after the diviſion of the Empire and the ten Kings riſen in the Provinces thereof, and not before, the Romane falſe Prophet with the reſt of the inhabitants of the Weſt for diſtinction ſake was called; and that even of thoſe, to whom the Revelation was written, the ſeven Churches of Aſia. For the Greeks &amp; the other Eaſtern people, w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> whom the name abode in that diviſion of the Empire, would have themſelves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Romans;</hi> they termed us with our Pope, and under him the Biſhops, Kings, and Rulers, <hi>Latines,</hi> by a certaine fatall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct. And this very name the letters thereof being ſubducted after the manner of the Greeks and Hebrews, maketh up the number noted by the holy Ghoſt, but a myſticall number; wherein is ſhewed of what progenie the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is, and how falſly he brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth himſelf to be a ſucceſſour of the company of the Apoſtles, when as in truth he is of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>count the number of the Beaſt, for it is the number of a man: and his number is</hi> 666.</p>
                     <p>Which ſurely that it ought to be accounted after the ſame manner as I have ſaid, I ſeeme to gather out of the Analogie of the company of <hi>virgins</hi> whoſe number 144 contrary to the Beaſt, is altogether Apoſtolicall, begotten of twelve multiplyed by it ſelf. For the reaſon of contraries is contrary. And there indeed both, as well the <hi>Name written,</hi> as the <hi>Number</hi> of the company written upon, the holy Ghoſt hath expreſſed; but here he hath left the <hi>Name</hi> to be conjectured out of the <hi>Number.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That therefore I may comprehend the matter in few words, <hi>to receive the Marke of the Name of the Beaſt;</hi> is to ſubject him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his authoritie, and to acknowledge him to be his Lord; but to receive the <hi>Number,</hi> is to imbrace his impietie, derived unto him from the <hi>Dragon,</hi> to wit, the Idolatry of the Latines. Whence that happily will not be unworthy conſideration: although no man can receive the marke of the <hi>Name of the Beaſt,</hi> or be ſubject to his authoritie, but together alſo he muſt receive his <hi>Number,</hi> that is, he muſt needs be partaker of his impietie: yet it may be, that one may admit the <hi>Number</hi> or impietie of the Beaſt, but yet refuſe the <hi>Marke</hi> or <hi>Name.</hi> That which now long ſince is true of the Greeks, who howſoever they imbrace the ſame forme of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, derived from the <hi>Dragon,</hi> or Idolatry of the <hi>Latines,</hi> and the ſame eſtabliſhed at the firſt in that ſecond Nicene Councell by the authoritie of the <hi>Latine Pope</hi> who earneſtly laboured even there alſo to ſet up the <hi>Image of the ſlaine Dragon:</hi> yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to be ſubject to the Latine Pope, or to beare his <hi>Name</hi> as in times paſt (before they departed aſunder a Schiſme being made) they have refuſed now for about 700 yeers.</p>

The order of theſe is twofold; firſt of a threefold admonition to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Beaſt, repreſented by ſo many loud voyces of Angels; ſecondly, of revenge, by a parable of <hi>Harveſt</hi> and <hi>Vintage.</hi> The firſt of the monitory Angels is that, which he here calleth <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> another indeed, as I have ſaid, in reſpect of thoſe muſicall Angels a little before mentioned, of the number of which this Evangeliſt was not. And here we are to call to remembrance (what before I ſhewed) that the Angels in ſuch like viſions, doe repreſent them over whom they have the government; and that which is done in common or by the works of both, that is ſaid to come to paſſe, the Angels being Authors, as it were Guides and Conductors of the thing done. And hence immediatly it may be imagined, that the Angel flying ſo loftily (if ſo be that alſo ought to be eſteemed as any part of the parable) is the Ruler not of any eſtate of men whatſoever, but of a more eminent ranke, and is to uſe ſuch for the declaring of his Goſpel.

                  <p>The firſt Angel calling to remembrance that now the time of the kingdom of God is at hand when iudgement is to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon Idols and Idolaters; and ſo the Devils now being caſt down and deſpoyled of the Roman throne, is begun already to be put in execution: therefore he exhorteth the nations, kindreds, tongues and people, who from that time were become Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that being mindfull hereof, they worſhip that onely true God the Creator, as he is declared in the Goſpel, and that they take heed of Idols: <hi>Peare,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>God,</hi> that is, <hi>reverence and give him glory,</hi> even the glory of adoration and religious worſhip; as in the words following it is expounded. <hi>Becauſe the time of his iudgement is come,</hi> that is, wherein Chriſt by his Croſſe hath ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led powers and principalities, and hath by his Apoſtles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts declared to the nations, which through ſo many ages he had ſuffered to walke in their own wayes, that they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from their Idols: if not, then at his returne from heaven, they ſhould be puniſhed with eternall death. Wherefore then ſhould Chriſtians who profeſſe faith in Ieſus Chriſt this Iudge, and triumpher over Devils returne as it were by a back doore to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Idols and Devils again.</p>

                  <p>But thou wilt ſay when, and where, and by what Miniſters I pray you did this Angel execute his declaration? Certaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambles thereof were given out, when firſt ſuperſtition began to grow in the Church, at the monuments and about the reliques of the Martyrs, as appeareth out of the Hiſtory of <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> with whom, withſtanding ſuch like ſuperſtition, many others, even of the Biſhops of that time were of opinion, witneſſe <hi>Ierom</hi> his adverſary who undeſervedly with bitter words inveighed againſt him for this cauſe. But this denunciation appeareth to be moſt manifeſtly fulfilled, from the yeere of our Lord 720, in the Greek and Eaſterne Churches, where this Evangelizing Angel did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed flye <gap reason="foreign">

Let the Reader reſort to the teſtimonies which I cited out of <hi>Theophanes</hi> concerning this matter, when I treated of the two horned Beaſt. Moreover, by the authoritie of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, a Councell conſiſting of 338 Biſhops was aſſembled at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and by their unanimous conſent, the adoration of Images was accuſed and condemned of impietie. Thou wilt ſay Reader that the ſentence of the Synod if it be not trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to thee to reade it, is the ſelfe ſame Sermon of this Angel, and grounded upon the ſame foundation with it, according to our interpretation.

Of which act, if there be any doubt, I have witneſſe; Firſt, the Author of the Confutation of this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinopolitan</hi> definition, inſerted in the Acts of the ſecond Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Nice.</hi> Who when he had taken upon him to confute the firſt Edition thereof, to thoſe Canons thus he ſaid: <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Whatſoever it may be; this appeareth out of the teſtimonies already brought, that by the uſe of this very word, it was at that time eſteemed that that ſuperſtition towards the Saints departed this life, was nouriſhed and cheriſhed. Which, that it might by all means and pollicie be hindred, the uſe thereof was forbidden: not indeed ſimply and univerſally, which our Adverſaries falſly alleadge; but onely in naming of Temples, which were dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the memory of the Apoſtles and Martyrs. For the taking away of that errour, as it ſeemeth, whereby it was beleeved ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that thoſe were places of approaching to God by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Martyrs, or conſecrated to the worſhipping of them whoſe names they did beare. Therefore in ſtead of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it ſeemed fit to put in place thereof that of <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> indeed no leſſe honourable: whether with full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and adviſe, it is his part to judge, who hath well and throughly looked into all the circumſtances of that time, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the action. In the meane time it nothing detracteth from the virginitie or puritie of the Church, if haply ſometimes in ſuch things which belong to the way and manner of the doing of a thing, it ſhall not ſo wiſely diſcerne. For it is no matter of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie that ſhe who is chaſte, perpetually either doe, or ſpeake wiſely. For the like reaſon in a manner, the word <hi>Prieſt</hi> for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall Elders, <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for the Sacrament of the Euchariſt (not to name other the like) are commanded not to be uſed in very many Reformed Churches. And not indeed altogether

raſhly, except (as it ſeemeth to ſome) the name <hi>Miniſters</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead <note place="margin">Chap. 14.</note> thereof be not a name fit enough: by which although they who exerciſe a ſacred Function may be called rightly and by war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Scripture; yet thereby are not Elders diſtinguiſhed from Deacons.

                  <p>As if he ſhould ſay, this cry ſhall be the touchſtone, of proving as well the patience as the obedience of the Saints. Of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience ſurely, if reſting upon expectation of ſo terrible puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuch as ſhall recompence all the delay, they ſhall be nothing troubled with ſo long proſperitie of the Beaſt, nor be any whit dejected in their mindes at that madneſſe of perſecution wherewith the refractory, and diſobedient to his government ſhall be aſſailed: and of obedience to the Commandements of God and the faith of Ieſus, if having heard this threatning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further delay, they withdraw themſelves from communion with the Beaſt, and renounce his Image and Marke. <hi>Theſe are they who keepe the Commandements of God, and the faith of Ieſus,</hi> that is, which rightly and Evangelically worſhip God in the faith of Ieſus Chriſt: and therefore not unworthy to be called by the name of profeſſours of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>So the Virgin Church having obeyed the threefold admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the vindication of her againſt her enemies followeth, under the type of <hi>Harveſt</hi> and <hi>Vintage;</hi> which once being overpaſt, the

                  <p>I know very many referre this heavenly declaration to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as it were to comfort the Saints now to ſuffer all grievous things, from the Beaſt provoked by the precedent voyce. Of which opinion lately alſo I my ſelfe was. But now having waied the matter more exactly, I incline to thinke rather that it ſhould be referred to the matters following, as it were a warning of the reſurrection and judgement preſently ſucceeding under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth trumpet; the preparation of which ſhould beginne to be taken in hand in the next viſion. So that that may be called, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>from this time,</hi> not in reſpect of the matter exhibited in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer viſion; but the next following to be exhibited; upon which immediately, the reſurrection of the dead and the judgement ſhould follow. As if he had ſaid: Now it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>me to that which onely remaineth to be fulfilled, to that time wherein <hi>the dead in the Lord</hi> ſhall be raiſed up to a bleſſed life. For in the Goſpel of <hi>Matthew</hi> 23. the laſt <hi>verſ.</hi> the Lord ſaith to the Iewes: <hi>You ſhall not ſee me,</hi>

                     <hi>untill you ſhall ſay, Bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord,</hi> that is, not from the moment of time wherein he had ſpoken theſe things, but from the time of the Paſſeover, which he went then to celebrate: after which he no more offered himſelfe to be ſeene publikely of the Iewes. Now the reaſon moving me ſo to thinke, as I ſay, is threefold. Firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I remember not that any where in the ſacred Scripture, the day of death, but onely the day of reſurrection and judgement is named a <hi>day of reward.</hi> Secondly, the denunciation from heaven, with a commandement to write, ſeemeth not to be uſed, but to ſhew ſome notable importance of matters. Certainely ſuch like commandement is no where elſe to be found, except in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the whole Propheſie. To conclude, if good attention be given to this thing declared, in ſenſe it altogether agreeth with that at the ſounding of the ſeventh Trumpet, <hi>Cap.</hi>

                  <p>But whatſoever the <hi>Harveſt</hi> may be, ſurely the deſcription proveth that the Lord thereof and the Author of the reaping ſhould be Chriſt himſelfe the King.

So that it is in no wiſe ſafe in my judgement to wreſt that to any other meaning. It ſeemeth rather to be gathered that the power of the Divine Majeſtie in accompliſhing that <hi>Harveſt,</hi> as alſo in the next enſuing <hi>Vintage,</hi> ſhall be more conſpicuous and notable, then hath happened in any works hitherto, of thoſe which are done in the names only of Angels.</p>

For by ſo many furlongs he enformeth the ſlaughter ſhall <note place="margin">Chap. 14.</note> be made without the <hi>Citie.</hi> That is, if I be not deceived, in the Region or Dominion of the <hi>Citie.</hi> Hence it commeth to paſſe, that ſome by that circuit thinke the Holy Land is meant, as which comprehendeth exactly ſo many furlongs in the length thereof, that is, <hi>two hundred Italian miles,</hi> but not above <hi>an hundred and threeſcore Gracian;</hi> which to be the length of the Holy Land, <hi>Ierome</hi> relateth in his Epiſtle to <hi>Dar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>anus.</hi> For the <hi>Gracians,</hi> ſay they, meaſured their miles by ten furlongs, every of which was an hundred paces; now a pace (which they call <hi>Orgya</hi> a faddom) is ſixe <hi>Romane</hi> foot: ſo in the whole a <hi>Grecian</hi> mile contained 6000 <hi>Romane</hi> foot. On the contrary the <hi>Romanes</hi> define a pace by five foot, a furlong by 125 paces, a mile by eight furlongs, that is, only 5000 foot. Whence it commeth to paſſe, that the <hi>Grecian</hi> mile, although it agree with the <hi>Romane</hi> in the number of 1000 paces, yet it is greater by a fift part then the <hi>Romane.</hi> By which means 200 <hi>Romane</hi> miles make not above 160 <hi>Grecian.</hi> This is the ſumme of the account. Furthermore, this addeth no little weight to the conjecture, that the name of the place is expreſſed by an <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Armageddon,</hi> as if it were to come to paſſe in the land of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> But by what means ſhall this be brought to paſſe? Surely, to thoſe that conceive Antichriſt ſhall come out of the Eaſt, this opinion is eaſie and prompt enough; to us not ſo; except any one haply may thinke it likely, that the falſe Prophet after the overthrow of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall remove into the Eaſt, and Seat himſelfe there. Indeed there are ſome of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Beaſt themſelves who affirme this; to wit, that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall have his Seat at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> before the laſt Day of Iudgement. For indeed it cannot be affirmed with any likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of truth, that the Beaſt, his affaires at home in the Weſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch ſtate and danger as is ſuppoſed, ſhould again (as long agoe in the expedition to <hi>Ieruſalem)</hi> Lead an Army into <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> leaving ſo many enemies at his back; and there at length ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly be aboliſhed.

                  <p>But whither goe I? let us ceaſe to be (as happily hitherto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have been) too curious. Let us deſcend to other matters, which will be more worth our labour. And ſo let the Reader firſt marke this: that here the Cutter of the cluſters of the Vine, is not the ſame as is the Treader of the winepreſſe: but as the functions of the grape gatherer and the Treader of the winepreſſe are ſeverall, ſo alſo they have ſeverall workmen; for the grape gathering or cutting of the cluſters, an Angel furniſhed with a Vinedreſſers ſickle; for the treading, Chriſt himſelf the King accompanyed with a heavenly troope of horſemen. Which out of the viſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. (which I have ſo often cited) may evidently appeare. For there <hi>Iohn ſaw heaven opened, and behold a white horſe, and he</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>which ſate upon him was called faithfull and true, and with righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe he iudgeth and maketh warre—and he was clothed</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">13.</note> 
                     <hi>with a veſture ſprinkled with blood</hi> (with the blood of grapes) <hi>and his name is called The Word of God. And the armies which are</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">14.</note> 
                     <hi>in heaven followed him on white horſes, and clothed with white ſilke and cleane: And out of his mouth goeth a ſharpe ſword, that with</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">15.</note> 
                     <hi>it he ſhould ſmite the nations: for he ſhall rule them with a rod of iron; and he it is who treadeth the winepreſſe of the fierce wrath of God Almightie—&amp;c.</hi> Can any thing be more plainly ſpoken? And furthermore in the context, to which we give light accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our abilitie, it is no where ſaid, that the Angel who gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or cut the cluſters of grapes, is the ſame alſo as did tread the winepreſſe; but only that he caſt the cut cluſters of grapes into <hi>the winepreſſe.</hi> Which being done, <hi>the winepreſſe is troden without the Citie.</hi> And by whom but by Chriſt the King, comming forth of heaven with his heavenly troope of horſemen? That forſooth it is, which the holy Ghoſt would ſignifie, by mentioning of <hi>horſes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 20.</note> immediatly added: <hi>and blood,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>came out of the winepreſſe even to the horſe bridles.</hi> For wherefore is that concerning horſes inſerted, unleſſe by this marke he might give notice, that the winepreſſe ſhould be troden by him, to whom that company of horſemen belonged.</p>
                  <p>That therefore I may comprehend the matter in few words; this is the ſumme of that viſion of the vintage. The Angel the Vintager with the helpe of the Saints, the government of whom
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:111329:130"/>
for the effecting of this buſineſſe is committed to him, ſhall lop <note place="margin">Chap. 14.</note> and cut away the cluſters of grapes belonging to the Beaſt; and by that his cutting off ſhall cauſe them to be gathered together into <hi>Armageddon;</hi> and being gathered together the <hi>Lord Ieſus</hi> ſhall tread them at his comming: according to which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, concerning the <hi>man of ſinne</hi> (which is this ſelfe ſame Beaſt) that he ſhall be deſtroyed by the Lord, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Now both as well the <hi>Harveſt</hi> as the <hi>Vintage,</hi> is obtained by prayers: the Harveſt (as it ſeemeth) by the prayers of the Church univerſally: for the Angel which there beareth the perſon of the ſuppliants, is ſaid to come generally out of the Temple: but the vintage rather by the prayers of the Martyrs and Confeſſors, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom the wicked ones exerciſed crueltie with ſlaughters and torments, and ſacrificed then to Chriſt; wherefore the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel which calleth for this, commeth out of the place where the Altar ſtandeth, and is ſaid <hi>to have power over the fire,</hi> even the fire of Martyrdome. For that is commonly known, that the blood of <note place="margin">Verſ. 18.</note> the Martyrs cryeth to God for revenge. For ſurely the Scripture every where witneſſeth, that the divine power will beſtow nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proſperitie upon the Church, nor inflict puniſhment upon their enemies, without their prayers. So at the prayers of <hi>Daniel</hi> the captivitie of Babylon is ſet at libertie. And in the parable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the widow wearying the unjuſt Iudge with her clamors, the <note n="*" place="margin">Apodoſis.</note> application is, that God in like manner conſtrained by the prayers of his Elect, will at length riſe up to their revenge.

But if you make enquiry what is like to happen to the Iuſt, in thoſe thouſand yeers, wherein God which is holy and bleſſed ſhall renew his world, touching which it is ſaid, And the Lord alone ſhall be exalted in that day; we muſt know, that the Lord ſhall give them as it were the wings of an Eagle to flie upon the face of the waters.

By theſe and the like let the Reader learne, why Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> doth ſo much charge the <hi>Millinaries</hi> with <hi>Iudaiſme:</hi> whereon he ſo earneſtly inſiſteth, that this may ſeeme to be his prime ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, whereby he may convince that erroneous opinion. But howſoever that opinion be true or falſe, whether thoſe Fathers were in an error or no; to be of the ſame minde with the Iewes is not alwaies culpable. But if otherwiſe; why doe we not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode <hi>the world to come, Gehenna,</hi> and <hi>Paradiſe?</hi> Doe not we Chriſtians conſent with the Iewes in theſe things? Have not we the names likewiſe <hi>(of the Kingdome of Heaven and the Day of Iudgement)</hi> from the Iewiſh <hi>Robbins?</hi> For where are thoſe things read in the Old Teſtament? which yet are very frequent among the Iewiſh Doctors.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, who hearing the opinion of the ancient Iewes touching the one thouſand yeeres of the day of Iudgement, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but thinke with himſelfe that he is moved to beleeve it, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> with them (for both his Epiſtles are directed to the Iewes) ſpeaking of the <hi>Day of Iudgement,</hi> and preſently after the mentioning thereof adding, <hi>You are not ignorant, that one day with the Lord is as a thouſand yeeres,</hi> would confirme the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> touching that matter? Eſpecially when thoſe words doe not ſeeme to be taken out of the <hi>Pſalme</hi> (as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion is) but out of the <hi>Vulgar</hi> forme and manner of the Iewes making mention of the <hi>Day of Iudgement.</hi> Yea he will further think; unles Chriſt the Lord and his Apoſtles had uſed the name of the <hi>Day of Iudgement</hi> being derived from the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe with them, why have they not ſome where declared it? Is it not a dangerous matter, yea the high way to deceive men to uſe in doctrine the words and phraſes of ſuch as are erroneous without all caution and note of diſſent?</p>
                  <p>Seeing theſe things are ſo, I leave it to the judgement of learned men and great Divines to judge, whether this be not the beſt and eaſieſt way to deale with the Iewes; not to wreſt thoſe plaine Propheſies touching things appertaining to the laſt and glorious coming of Chriſt, to his firſt coming; but to perſwade them that they expect none other <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who can fulfill all thoſe things, namely changing thoſe things that are to be changed (for a Chriſtian muſt conſent no further with the Iewes in any thing, then his profeſſion doth give him leave) then that <hi>Ieſus</hi> of
